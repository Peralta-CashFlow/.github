# CashFlow

Managing your money has never been easier! CashFlow is a modern and intuitive financial tracking app designed to help you take control of your finances effortlessly.

With an friendly user interface you will be able to register your incomes and expenses and with the help of generated graphics you will be able to understand what is happening on your financial life.

## Project Architecture

The project is based on microservices architecture where we will have multiple APIs each one with your responsibility strongly defined. 

The chosen architecture will make the app easy to scale up, improve maintenance and facilitate errors identification and treatment.

## Project Organization

For the project organization we will use [Github Projects](https://github.com/Peralta-CashFlow/.github/projects) to create a kind of Scrum board where we will define the US to be developed and also the tasks
that must be linked to PRs making it easier to track the development evolution.

## Documentation

All applications will have a GitHub pages with Swagger documentation to help on understanding.

## Good Practices

We strongly believe that good practices are the pillar to develop an amazing solution. Here are some of ours practices:

- Unit Tests: All APIs need to have at least 80% of code coverage;
- Clean Code: Will use [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/) to maintain our code clean;
- Commits: All commits should follow [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards;

* All those practices will be enforced with the help of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
